# Auralens
Aura Lens uses a Raspberry Pi to assist visually impaired users by providing real-time environmental info through smart glasses. It captures and processes images, performs object detection, and delivers auditory feedback via an earpiece. The system integrates Flutter for the app, Firebase for data management, and Python for image analysis.
